## Welcome to my Machine Learning Notebook

This repository contains a documented copy of my Machine learning notes. Each Lesson has its own `README` file so please take a look at the things I understand from each Lesson. 

To try some of these code yourself. Please make your own `venv` and run the code: `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.

If anything is unclear in this repository, feel free to email me at `anson.chin22@imperial.ac.uk`
